## Download

You can download the latest release from the [the releases page](https://github.com/abdusco/immich-muzei/releases/latest).


## Current features

- Connect to your Immich server using server URL and API key
- Browse and select albums to display
- Browse and select people (named faces) to display, with a checkbox list and face thumbnails
- Browse and select tags to filter photos
- Filter photos by date range
- Show only favorited photos (optional)
- Automatically rotates through random photos from selected albums/people/tags

### How albums and people combine

Albums and people form a single pool of sources. Each wallpaper refresh draws photos from
one entry in that pool, cycling through them in turn — so selecting two albums and three
people gives you photos from *any* of those five sources, not only photos that satisfy all
of them at once. Tags, "favorites only" and the date filter are applied on top of whichever
source is drawn. Selecting nothing means the whole library.
- "Open in Immich" action to view the current photo in your Immich instance
- "Add to favorites" action within Muzei UI and using an app shortcut.
